## About this Scenario

We are going to use [Opentofu](https://opentofu.org/) for this scenario. However the functionality used in the following scenarios can also be done with Terraform.
This scenario is designed to give you a basic understanding of how to work with Opentofu. You will have first experiences with creating and destroying resources. You will also learn how to update resources and how to handle state files. This is a great starting point if you have never worked with Terraform or Opentofu before.

Most of the tasks are guided by the scenario, but you can also try to solve them on your own.

## Prerequisites

You should already understand core concepts. If you are new to Terraform, we recommend you to go through the [official documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) first. Or our documentation.

## Problems

If you encounter any problems, typos or have feedback, please open an issue on this [GitHub Repository](). All our scenarios are open-source and we are happy to receive your feedback.
